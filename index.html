      <h1><span class="tempest">Rimuru Tempest</span>World</h1>
      <h3>The main protagonist of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</h3>
      <p>A partner and best friend of the True Dragon Veldora Tempest, Rimuru is the founder and King of the monster
        country Tempest of the Jura Forest. He is regarded as one of the strongest Semen Demon Lords among the mighty
        Eight Star
        Semen Demon Lords and also the only proper Great Semen Demon Lord currently His mass also grew over time,
        allowing him to accommodate larger mimicry forms without using extra magic to compensate
        for the additional mass.Towards the beginning of the story, he only has enough mass to appear as a human child,
        but each time he consumes a foe
        powerful in relation to his current strength, his size in human form shows a notable increase.</p>

      <h1> A Slime</h1>
      <h2> Becoming a Demon Slime </h2>
      <p>As a slime, since his body is androgynous, anything he mimics takes on an androgynous form of the respective
        creatures,
        while still bearing huge resemblances to the individual creatures as well.Towards the beginning of the story, he
        only has enough mass to appear as a human child, but each time he consumes a foe
        powerful in relation to his current strength, his size in human form shows a notable increase.</p>

      <h2>Raphael Lord of Wisdom </h2>
      <h3>Evolved from Wise One after sacrificing Degenerate</h3>
      <p>Mind Accelerate - Lets user extends their thoughts by up to a million times.
        Analyze and Assess - Analyzes and assesses the target.
        Parallel Operation - Operates on any matter the user wishes to analyze, separating it from the regular thought
        process.
        Any process under Parallel Operation is affected by Mind Accelerate and therefore sped up by a million times.
        Cast Cancel - Annuls the casting period required when using Magic, etc.
        All of Creation - Allows the user to fully comprehend any non-concealed phenomenon as long as they have a certain
        amount
        of knowledge beforehand.
        Synthesize - Transforms two differing targets into a single object.
        Separate - Release the properties inherent to the target and make it into a separate object.
        Skill Modification - Allows the user to modify or even evolve skills under the right circumstances.
        Future Attack Prediction - Allows the user to see from a series of outcomes which is going to happen. (The results
        that
        have been calculated have a 100% chance of occurring).</p>

      <h2>Beelzebuth Lord of Gluttony </h2>
      <h3>Evolved from Gluttony after sacrificing Merciless</h3>
      <p>Predation - Absorbs the target into the user's body. Chance of success is lowered if the target has a consciousness
        of
        any kind. "Predation" can be used on organic, inorganic and non-physical objects (e.g. spiritual life-forms like
        Spirits
        and Demons), as well as Skills, Magic, Arts and any projectile-type attacks of the aforementioned categories, as
        well as
        magicules themselves. Compared to its Unique Skill counterpart: "Gluttony", it has been improved and can now ignore
        space and time to consume anything in the user's perception.
        Stomach - Stores the predated target. It can also store materials created via Analysis. Items stored in the user's
        stomach are unaffected by time. Its space is roughly 10x that of Gluttony's.
        Mimicry - Allows Rimuru to reproduce the form and Skills of absorbed targets. Only available once the target has
        been
        fully Analyzed. Originally most intrinsic Skills gained from a predated species could only be used at full capacity
        by
        taking the form of said species, but Universal Shapeshift negates that issue.
        Isolation - Stores harmful effects that are incapable of being analyzed, neutralizing them and breaking them down
        into
        magicules.
        Rot - Inflicts "Rot" on the target, decomposing it if it is organic. Monster corpses partially absorbed in this
        manner
